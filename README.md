## Todo Android App

A GitHub repository which contains the complete source code of the Android app using MVVM Architecture. 

### Description

As we developer know, it is always good to maintain the clean code. This project is completely based on MVVM architecture using the mock api with dummy data. https://designer.mocky.io/design. The good thing with this link is that you can create your own dummy APIs with your own set of JSON data.

This app demonstrates the CRUD operation where an user can see all of his tasks. He has the option to create new todo task as well. Currently, this app uses dummy API json data. When the user opens the app, the api gets called and saves the available data inside ROOMDB. Gradually, I will update the project with other features like adding new task, deleting the old one and updating the selected one. 

This project is 100% Kotlin.
